### About
Welcome to fancy settings! Are you ready for tabs, groups, search, good style?  
Let's get started, it takes only a few minutes...

### Howto
Download fancy settings and get started right away.  
Unzip the download and your good to go!

You can open the index.html file as-is and take a look what the result will look like.  
Now, let's get your own settings in there...

There are three files that are interesting for you:

* manifest.js
* icon.png
* settings.js

If you just want to get some settings without any customization, you can just edit the manifest.json file and change the icon.  
The manifest.json file includes samples of all available settings, so you can just see how it works and edit it to fit your needs.

But if you want to customize, you have two options:

1. You can use the manifest to generate your settings and customize it in the settings.js file.
2. Or you can programmatically generate your settings in the settings.js file.
